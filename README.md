# Working-through-Senn-2002-
These are my notes working through the primary content in Senn (2002), *Cross-over trials in clinical research*. There are no plans to make this into an ebook, and I probably won't even work through the whole book. I'm just covering the content that seems helpful for my work at the moment.
